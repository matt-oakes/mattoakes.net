        <h2>Pose.Party</h2>
        <p>Pose.Party is a fun game for virtual events and groups of friends to play together in real-time remotely. They first join a video call with a host, who will guide them through the game. After opening a link on their phone and entering their name, they are shown a prompt such as "Peace" and will have 30 seconds to pull the best pose they can. At the end of the round each player scores everyone else with a simple swipe left or right.</p>
        <p>The game was created at the start of the first 2020 lockdown for <a href="https://photobot.co/">Photobot</a> to provide a virtual version of their photobooth. It was developed for the web, rather than as a mobile app, to allow players to play without needing to download and install anything. It was written using React and uses Firebase as a backend. This was the perfit fit for the game as it allowed the data and snapshots to be synced to all players in real time.</p>
        <p>After the initial MVP version of the game was created and released, we have worked together to add many additional features such as whitelabeling, custom game branding, and support for very large games with hundreds of simultaneous players.</p>

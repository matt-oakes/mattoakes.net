        <h2>Medibuddy</h2>
        <p>Medibuddy is a medical education website which aims to make life easier for junior doctors applying for their training posts. It features a range of professionally written question banks to help junior doctors prepare for interviews.</p>
        <p>The team approached me to release a mobile app version of their existing website. It needed to proide access to the same question banks in a format that is quick to pick up and can be used while  on-the-go. As the app needed to work for both Android and iOS devices, we decided to use <a href="/guides/react-native/">React Native</a>. This allowed me to develop the app quicking with a single codebase for both platforms. The app was developed in four weeks with a small budget.</p>

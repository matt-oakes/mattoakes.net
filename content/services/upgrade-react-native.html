        <h2>Need Help Upgrading React Native?</h2>
        <p>React Native is great for build scalable and cross platform applications, but keeping up with the release pace of the framework can be difficult. The framework is closely tied to the structure of your project and it can be difficult to know the exact steps you need to take to upgrade.</p>

        <h3>Why upgrade React Native?</h3>
        <p>It is important to keep up-to-date with your React Native version. New versions bring performance increases, bug fixes, and new features which you can only get through upgrading. They also add compatibility for the new versions of Android and iOS which are released each year.</p>
        <p>Apple and Google will also require that apps use the latest version of their SDKs, which are only officially supported by the latest version of React Native. Here are some recent and upcoming deadlines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>July 2020:</strong> Apps using React Native 0.59 and below cannot be uploaded to the App Store or Google Play Store.</li>
            <li><strong>April 2021:</strong> All iOS apps must be built using Xcode 12 and the iOS 14 SDK. This is officially supported in React Native 0.63.</li>
            <li><strong>August 2021:</strong> All new Android apps on Google Play must target SDK level 30 (Android 11). This will be officially supported in an upcoming version of React Native.</li>
            <li><strong>November 2021:</strong> All updates to existing Android apps on Google Play must target SDK level 30 (Android 11).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why me?</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <p>I am an experienced React Native developer who has a background in both Android and iOS native development. This puts me in the perfect place to understand all sides of React Native and how upgrading needs to be done for each app. I have upgraded dozens of React Native apps to the latest version and can do it more efficiantly and correctly than someone performing the upgrade for the first time.</p>

        <h3>Hire me to perform the upgrade for you</h3>
        <p> After signing a contract, you will provide me access to the source code and some test account details, and I can perform the upgrade for you. This will require minimal interaction with your team, so they can focus on feature development as usual. When the upgrade is complete I will send a pull request to your developers for them to verify that everything is working as expected. Depending on availability, the upgrade process can be completed in as little as a week.</p>

        <h3>What does it cost?</h3>
        <p>When you contact me with the details of your app, I will provide a fixed price quote for the upgrade. Here are the price brackets I have, depending on the complexity of your application and the state of the current code.</p>

                <h4>Typical - £1,400</h4>
                <p>An averaged sized app which is either using a fairly old version of React Native, uses some libraries which also need upgrading, or does not have good test coverage.</p>

                <h4>Complex - £2,000</h4>

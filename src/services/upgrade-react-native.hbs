        <h2>Upgrade React Native</h2>
        <p>React Native is great for build scalable and cross platform applications, but keeping up with the release pace of the framework can be difficult. The framework is closely tied to the structure of your project and it can be difficult to know the exact steps you need to take to upgrade.</p>

        <h3>Why upgrade React Native?</h3>
        <p>It is important to keep up-to-date with your React Native version. New versions bring performance increases, bug fixes, and new features which you can only get through upgrading. Frequently, they also add compatibility for the new versions of Android and iOS which are released each year. Apple and Google will also drop support for apps which use older version of frameworks like React Native. For example, from August 2019 you cannot release an app which uses a React Native version prior to 0.59.</p>

        <h3>Why me?</h3>
        <p>I am an experienced React Native developer who has a background n both Android and iOS native development. This puts me in the perfect place to understand all sides of React Native and how upgrading needs to be done for each app. I am also a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/react-native-community/people">React Native Community Contributor</a> and therefore have an insight into releases before they happen.</p>

        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>When you contact me I will get back to you with a series of questions to understand the current state of your project. We can then discuss the options for getting you to the latest version of React Native. Once you are up-to-date we can also put in place a contract so I can upgrade your app whenever a new major version is released.</p>

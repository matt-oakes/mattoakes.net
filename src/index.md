                <p>Many developers could build you <em>an</em> app, however, I will work hard to ensure I build you <em>the perfect</em> app. From the very start of the process, I will ensure I understand your business goals and the needs of your users. I can then use my experience with both the Android & iOS platforms to build and improve your mobile apps in a way which will delight your users and provide you a great return on your investment. All through the process I will work with three goals in mind: achieving your business goals, fulfilling your user's needs, and crafting a solid app which can be improved and built upon in the future.</p>

                <h3>Business goals</h3>
                <p>A great app is useless if it does not provide value to your company. Throughout working with you, I will ensure I learn about your business goals and work hard to ensure that your mobile app is supporting them.</p>

            <div id="user-needs" class="me-trait">
                <h3>User needs</h3>
                <p>I build apps with a clear goal to ensure that users will love to them. This is great for your customers and you as they will be happier, more passionate about your app, and want to keep coming back to use it.</p>

                <h3>Craft</h3>
                <p>Things change fast in business — this is especially true with mobile. To deal with change quickly and effectively you need to have a solid foundation. I pride myself on crafting solid apps which can be improved quickly & effectively.</p>
